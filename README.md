# Heart-Disease-Predictor
This project looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries 
in an attempt to build a machine learning model which is capable of telling whether someone has heart disease or not based on their medical attributes

Problem Definition:
Given the clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease

The data is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,also taken from kaggle in the form of csv file.
